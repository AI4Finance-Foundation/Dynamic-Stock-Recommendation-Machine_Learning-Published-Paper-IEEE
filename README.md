Hongyang Yang, Xiao-Yang Liu, Qingwei W. A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic Stock Recommendation. IEEE TrustCom 2018. 

## Abstract: 
Stock recommendation is vital to investment companies and investors. However, no single stock selection strategy will always win while analysts may not have enough time to check all S&P 500 stocks (the Standard & Poor’s 500). In this paper, we propose a practical scheme that recommends stocks from S&P 500 using machine learning. Our basic idea is to buy and hold the top 20% stocks dynamically. First, we select representative stock indicators with good explanatory power. Secondly, we take five frequently used machine learning methods, including linear regression, ridge regression, stepwise regression, random forest and generalized boosted regression, to model stock indicators and quarterly log-return in a rolling window. Thirdly, we choose the model with the lowest Mean Square Error in each period to rank stocks. Finally, we test the selected stocks by conducting portfolio allocation methods such as equally weighted, mean- variance, and minimum-variance. Our empirical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the long-only strategy on the S&P 500 index in terms of Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.

## Index Term: 
Stock recommendation, fundamental value investing, machine learning, model selection, risk management

## Project summary：
+ We developed a practical approach to using machine-learning methods selecting S&P 500 stocks based on financial ratios (e.g., EPS, ROA, ROE, etc). Outperformed the S&P 500 index on out of sample data, achieved a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 (0.19 on SPX).
+ We performed feature selection by 11 GICS sectors based on a rolling window to choose the lowest MSE model among Linear Regression, Stepwise Regression, Regression with Ridge, Random Forest, and GBM. Applied a model ensemble method.
